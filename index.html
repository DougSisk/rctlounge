        <h3>Over 8 Years of Coaster Simulator Projects</h3>

        <p>It is with heavy heart that RCTLounge must cease operation. The park inspector has determined that ad revenues no longer meet the necessary amount needed to provide funds to power the site.</p>

        <p>We thank all of our members for over 8 years of great coaster simulator projects they posted on our site. Through thick and thin, our members were great. It truly is tough for us to have to shut off all of these amazing memories.</p>

        <p>We hope those that are still interested in coaster simulator games check out <a href="https://forum.rollercoastertycoon.com/" rel="nofollow">the official RollerCoaster Tycoon forums</a> or <a href="http://www.shyguysworld.com/" rel="nofollow">Shyguy's World</a> to continue their love.</p>
        <p>Once again: thank you.<p>

        <p><em>&ndash;RCTLounge Team</em></p>
